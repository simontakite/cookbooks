We agree that governance affects trade, but we said we shall agree on these after signing the mutual agreement,” 
said Mutahunga. He urged the Private sector to warm up for EPA saying they will be left in the dark unless they get on board.

Jane Nalunga the SEATINI Uganda country director said 10 years of negotiations makes everybody tired but urged for 
consistency so that the signing of EPAs benefits Uganda. “The EPA policies are very broad and does not address the 
challenges such as high unemployment rates facing the country at the moment,’ she said. Nalunga pointed out 
that the EPAs is after liberalizing the African markets. “Let’s only sign once we know it will benefit the grassroots woman in 
Luwero,” she said.

Ambassador Nathan Irumba a renowned WTO negotiator and former Ugandan envoy to Geneva warned against rushing to sign EPAs. 
“It is only 15 countries from the Caribbean under the CARIFORUM who have signed the full EPAs but just three years down the road 
there is nothing achievable on ground,” he said. He said the EPA implementation is a problem for many states. “By mid-2011 only 5 
f the 15 states that signed had set up the implementation units and there is nothing to show in terms of export and beneficial gains,” he said.

He noted that for over 30 years, exports from the ACP countries were given generous access to the European market, 
yet preferential access failed to boost local economies and stimulate growth in ACP countries.

The proportion of EU imports from ACP countries dropped from 7% to 3% of EU imports. Though Europe still remains a key 
mporter of EAC goods especially agriculture stuffs such as flowers, vegetables, fish and fish products, the EAC- EU exports continues to 
reduce with exports standing at 34% in 2003, dropping to 23.2% in 2007 and 10 18.9% in 2011.
