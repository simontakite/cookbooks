How to install this code:

(1) Uncompress the archive into your Apache document tree

	Example (for the .tar.gz file):
    mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
	cp wedding.tar.gz /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
    cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
    tar xvzf wedding.tar.gz

	Example (for the .zip file):
    mkdir /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
	cp wedding.zip /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
    cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wedding
    unzip wedding.zip

(2) Create the database, tables, and sample data:

    mysql -p<password> < wedding.db

(3) Move and edit db.dummy.inc

	mv db.dummy.inc db.inc
    edit db.inc with your fave editor and change the username and password 
    variables to match your username and password for accessing MySQL

	(NOTE: this creates a security problem because the user can read the
    contents of db.inc by retrieving it with their browser. There are at
    least three ways to fix this. The best is to add the following to
	your Apache httpd.conf file usually found in /usr/local/apache/conf/

	<Files ~ "\.inc$">
      Order allow,deny
      Deny from all
      Satisfy All
    </Files>

    Then, restart Apache with the command /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl
	restart  )

(4) Enjoy! If you followed step (1) above exactly, you should be able to
	use the application by requesting the following URL:

	http://localhost/wedding/
